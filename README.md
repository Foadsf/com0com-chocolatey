# com0com Chocolatey Package (Modified)

## Overview

This repository contains a **modified Chocolatey package** for `com0com`â€”a kernel-mode virtual serial port driver for Windows. The modification addresses issues with the previous package that used an **unsigned installer**, causing failures on systems enforcing driver signature verification.

## Features

- **Uses Signed Installer**: This package now downloads the signed version of the installer, resolving driver signature enforcement issues.
- **Automatic Architecture Detection**: The installation script selects the appropriate installer (`x64` or `x86`) based on your system architecture.
- **Silent Installation**: Seamless installation without user intervention.
